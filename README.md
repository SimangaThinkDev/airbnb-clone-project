# Airbnb Clone Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security

## Project Goals

- Build a robust backend system to handle user authentication, listings, bookings, and payments.
- Design and manage a relational database to store application data efficiently.
- Develop secure and well-documented RESTful and/or GraphQL APIs.
- Practice collaborative development using GitHub workflows and version control.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Integrate security best practices and scalable design principles.

## Tech Stack

- Backend Framework: Django
- Database: MySQL
- API Design: Django REST Framework and GraphQL
- Version Control & Collaboration: Git, GitHub
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker
- Containerization: Docker
- Documentation: Markdown (README.md)
